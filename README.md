# burgers

## Description
A site to add all the different burgers you want to eat and to see all the burgers you have already devoured. All your burgers will be stored and will be displayed each time you come back to the site. Add the burger name in the textbox, click the 'Add Burger' button and it will be added to the 'Burgz waiting to be devoured!' list, click the 'Eat' button and the burger will be moved to the 'Devoured burgz!' list. If you want to delete the burger, just click the 'x' button and it will be deleted from the list. The burger name can only be 30 characters long and if you try to add a burger without a name, an error message will appear.
